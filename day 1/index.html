        <h1 class="message">To my amazing husband,</h2>
            <p class="mess 1">  I have been thinking a lot lately about how incredibly blessed I am to be your girlfriend, and I just needed to put it into words. Sometimes the everyday moments pass by so quickly that I don’t pause long enough to tell you how deeply grateful I am for everything you do. You carry so much on your shoulders, yet you do it with strength, patience, and love. The way you show up for our relationship every single day — with dedication, integrity, and heart — does not go unnoticed. I see you, I appreciate you, and I admire you more than I can ever fully express.</p>
            <P class="mess 2">  Thank you for being my steady place in a world that can feel overwhelming. Your support gives me courage when I doubt myself, and your encouragement pushes me to grow into the best version of who I am. You believe in me even on days when I struggle to believe in myself. Knowing that I have a partner who stands beside me, who listens, who understands, and who truly cares about my heart, is a gift I never take for granted. Your love has created a safe space where I can be completely myself.</P>
            <P class="mess 3">  I am so thankful for the countless sacrifices you make — the long days, the hard work, and the quiet acts of service that you rarely ask recognition for. Whether it’s taking care of the little things, making me laugh when I need it most, or simply holding me close at the end of a long day, you show your love in ways both big and small. You lead with kindness, strength, and humility, and that is something I respect so deeply about you. Watching the way you love and care for us fills my heart with pride.</P>
            <p class="mess 4">  More than anything, I am grateful for the friendship we share. You are not just my Boyfriend; you are my best friend, my confidant, my partner in every sense of the word. The life we are building together means everything to me. Through every season — the joyful ones and the challenging ones — I would choose you again and again. Being your girlfriend is one of the greatest honors of my life, and loving you is the easiest thing I have ever done.</p>
            <p class="mess 5">  Thank you for loving me the way you do. Thank you for your patience, your laughter, your strength, and your unwavering devotion. I promise to always cherish you, support you, and stand beside you just as faithfully. My heart is so full because of you, and I am endlessly grateful that I get to call you mine.</p.5>
            <p class="mess 6">  So on this Valentine’s Day, I just want to say thank you. Thank you for being you, for loving me, and for sharing this incredible journey of life together. I love you more than words can express, and I am so excited for all the adventures that still lie ahead for us. Happy Valentine’s Day, my love.</p>
            <p class="hope">always yours, жена</p>
